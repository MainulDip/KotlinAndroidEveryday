### Data Storage, Serialization/De-serialization:
Serialization is the process of converting data used by an application to a format that can be transferred over a network or stored in a database or a file. In turn, deserialization is the opposite process of reading data from an external source and converting it into a runtime object.

### Basic Serialization:
```kotlin
```


### Writing/Reading file

* CRUD Directory and Text Files | Create, Read, Update, Delete
* CRUD with JSON Serialization | Create, Read, Update, Delete
* CRUD Protocol Buffers
